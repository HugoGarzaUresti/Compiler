# Compiler Project
## Description
### This project is a custom compiler developed using Python, leveraging the PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library for parsing and lexical analysis. The compiler includes several components, each responsible for a different aspect of the compilation process:

Lexer (lexer.py): Handles lexical analysis, tokenizing the input source code.
Parser (parser.py): Parses the tokens generated by the lexer and builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) or another form of intermediate representation.
Semantic Cube (SCube.py): Implements a semantic cube to ensure semantic correctness of operations by verifying operand types and operation compatibility.
Virtual Machine (VM.py): Executes the code based on the intermediate representation or bytecode generated by the parser.
Symbol Table (symbol_table.py): Manages a table of symbols to track variable/function/class names and their attributes throughout the compilation process.
Function Directory (DirFun.py) and Class Directory (DirClass.py): Manage function and class definitions, including their properties and methods.
Quadruples (Cuadruplos.py): Generates and manages quadruples, an intermediate representation for storing instructions.

## Prerequisites
Python > 3.9
PLY library

## Setup
Ensure Python 3.9 or higher is installed on your system.
Install PLY using pip:
`pip install ply`
Running the Compiler
To run the compiler, run:
Python:
`python parser.py programfile.txt
python vm.py out.txt`
